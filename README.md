# PneumoniaPrediction
Pneumonia prediction using InceptionV3

### Firstly the dataset is obtained from Kaggle:
### https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

The images are generally slower to load. Thus have converted it into numoy arrays and uploaded to google drive and directly used in Colab.

InceptionV3 model is used as the base architecture above which the final model is built and trained.
